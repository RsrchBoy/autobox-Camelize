=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.001 of autobox::Camelize - released March 16, 2013 as part of autobox-Camelize.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use autobox::Camelize;

    # $foo is 'this_is__my__name'
    my $foo = 'ThisIs::My::Name'->decamelize;

    # $bar is 'ThisIs::NotMy::Name'
    my $bar = 'this_is__not_my__name'->camelize;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple set of autobox methods that work on strings, and
camelize/decamelize them according to how the author thinks camelization
should work:

Camelizing replaces '__[a-z]' with '::[A-Z]', and '_[a-z]' with '[A-Z]'.
The first character is capitalized.

Decamelizing replaces '::[A-Z]' with '__[a-z]', and '[A-Z]' with '_[a-z]'.
The first character is lowercased.
